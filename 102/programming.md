# Programming with JavaScript

## Functions

> Are blocks of code that are designed for specific task, and are executed when something calls on it. It can be used the same way variables are used. It requires a function keyword, followed by a name, and then parentheses.
> - Ex. function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
>
> They can have letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. When listing parameters, those need to be placed within parentheses (arguments). These parameters behave like variables.
>
><br/>
>
> ### Why Functions?
>
> Because you create the code once, and reuse it as often as you need it, changing the parameters to get different results.
>
><br/>
>
> #### Operators
>
> - () - The function is what is written outside the parentheses, the result of that function is what is within the parentheses.
>
><br/>
>
> - #### Assignment 
>   - = - is and assignment operator that assigns the value of a variable.
>   - += - addition assignment operator which gives value to the variable.
>
><br/>
>
> - #### Arithmetic
>   - '+' - adds numbers
>   - '*' - multiples numbers
>   - '-' - subtract
>   - '**' - exponentiation
>   - '/' - divide
>   - '%' - modulus (division remainder)
>   - '++' - increment
>   - '--' - decerment

## Invocation

> This is the same as calling on the action of the function. So, when the code within the function is invoked, the function will execute based on the following:
>   - When an event occurs (user clicks a button)
>   - When it is invoked from JS code
>   - Automatically (self invoked)

<br/>

## Return

> The return value is the result of the function invoked. Once JS has reached the return statement, the function invoked will stop executing.

<br/>

## Local Variables

> These are declared with JS and you onlt access them from within the function itself. They are created at the start of the function and then deleted once the function is complete.
