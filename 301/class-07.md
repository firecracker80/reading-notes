## How I explained REST to my brother

>*Who is Roy Fielding?*
> - He contributed to the creation of the first web servers that transmitted data across the internet. He then conducted extensive study to understand why the web functions the way it does. He spends a lot of time discussing what those findings in the study I mentioned point to.
>
>*Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?*
> - Every programming language, database, and other sort of system has different ways to talk about nouns.
>
>*What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?*
> - The browser is informed of the protocol to use in that initial section. It can describe a location anywhere in the world while operating from any location. The Internet was built on this.
>
>*What does a GET do?*
> - It is used to make a data request to a particular resource.
>
>*What does a POST do?*
> - It is used to communicate information to a server so that it can generate or update resources.
>
>*What does PUT do?*
> - It does the same thing as POST, but PUT requests are idempotent.
>
>*What does PATCH do?*
> - Makes partial changes to a resource.

## The Movie DB API Docs

I am actually curious about what else the HTTP protocol can do, with better details.
