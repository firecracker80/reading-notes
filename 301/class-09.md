## Functional Programming Concepts

>*What is functional programming?*
> - Functional programming is a paradigm for designing computer programs that sees computing as the evaluation of mathematical functions and stays away from mutable and changing-state data.
>
>*What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?*
> - It does not have any discernible side effects and delivers the same result with the same arguments.
>
>*What are the benefits of a pure function?*
> - Easier to test and no mocking required.
>
>*What is immutability?*
> - Enduringly unchanged or incapable of modification.
>
>*What is Referential transparency?*
> - When given the same input, a function consistently produces the same outcome.
