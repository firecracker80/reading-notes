> |SQL                   |	            NoSQL                        |
> |:--------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
> |Predefined schema     | Dynamic schema                            | 
> |Table based databases | Document based                            |
> |Relational            | Non-relational                            |
> |For complex queries   | Better for the hierarchical data storage  |
> |Vertically scalable   | Horizontally scalbale                     |
>
>*What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?*
> - Complex queries.
>
>*Give a real world example.*

>*What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?*
> - Hierarchical data.
>
>*Give a real world example.*
> - The roles and positions on a team.

>*Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?*
> - NoSQL
>

>
>*What is a NoSQL database?*

>
>*What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?*
> - It lacks the complex query functionality found in SQL, it's not as mature, and it doesn't scale by itself.
