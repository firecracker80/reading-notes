>In Code 102, we learned a website needs 3 basic things, structure, style, and functionality. **HTML** provides the structure so that the flow of the page is easy to follow. It minimizes the confusion of what the creator is trying to convey. It's important to understand that there are different versions of HTML, the most currently used is HTML5. Each version has it's limitations and advantages. HTML5 introduces new elements that will provide clearer code.

>Coding is like training a soldier. When you start out you have this raw, blank canvas of a person, that is ready for you to mold them. First you have to whip them into shape, through various exercises and combat training. This builds their foundation for what is to come. Once you have accomplished this, you know have a solid framework to build from. Next, you begin to teach this person the specifics about the job they chose. You teach them through examples and hands-on instruction. This teaches them how the proper technique should look and be executed. Finally, you show them how everything comes together and works seamlessly in one or a series of actions that will achieve the desired goal.

>Molding and training the soldier is the HTML required as a preamble to what will be built later.  The specifics of the job is the CSS, this will prepare the site for a more visually asthetic presentation. Tying everything together through a series of actions is the JS, making the site functional.
