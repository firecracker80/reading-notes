# Reading Assignment 3

>CSS and JS are important is making your site visually stimulating and fun to navigate. With them, all you have is a white page with words that do absolutely nothing for the user. Using these languages to format your site will draw your user into your site further and further, which is what we want.

>The reading today was based on texts, boxes, the basics of JS, and loops and arrays. This reminds me of a toolbox. We all have toolboxes at home, and some of us in our cars. In this toolbox, I have sections or levels. The box itself is the HTML, and within in it are CSS, JS, and any other language learned. When I want to fix my page to look a certain way, I use CSS and all the nuts, bolts, and nails that are text, boxes, borders, radius, color. The moving parts of the site, for example, prompts, calculations, alerts, loops, and arrays are the screwdrivers, levels, wrenches, and other tools. Depending on what you want the site to do, with determine the tool you will select from your toolbox to accomplish the job and make it function the way you want it to.

## Things I want to know more about...

>After reading chapters 3 and 13 in the HTML/CSS book, I want to dive further into the what else I can do with the boxes and overall layout of the site. Also, after yesterday's JS exercise, I want to practice some more with JS, to include adding a level of complexity to my code using the loops and functions.
