# Reading Assignment 4

>Building a website is more complex than I initally thought. Platforms like, GoDaddy, Wix, Builderall, and the such, have over simplified the process so much, that when a lay person decideds to learn to code their expectations are not real. When working with these platforms, things like planning your layout, text, links, and functions are overlooked. It has already been done for you. As a user of these platforms, I felt limited, because there were boundaries and unedittable templates. Having begun this course, I realize now how important the planning stages are to creating a responsive, user-friendly, and attractive site is. Coding, opens up so many possibilities and opportunities during the actual build of a website. It makes it more customizable.

>In today's reading, how to input *links* in the `<a>` element has revealed so many errors made in the past. The big take away for me from that chapter was the use of relative URLs when linking to pages on the site. All you need is the file name, DONE! 
>
>The page *layout* is the beginning of the user's interaction with the site, because it speaks to how the information they consume will flow. A well organized page will keep the users eyes moving through the page in a way that makes sense, is aesthetically pleasing, and minimizes information overload. Something as simple as logo placement, can make all the difference on whether that user will continue to navigate your page. Understanding that each html element is a box, and how that box is presented, clarified the importance of content placement.
>
>Using *functions* to improve the site's functionality is quite complicated. I understood, however, that it simplfied code and is reusable for as many times as needed and is relevant. It reduces to need to repeat code and multiple outcomes are possible.

>I wantto take a closer look at the concept of page layout. I feel that layouts can become repetative and boring. I also want to spend more time practicing functions and arrays. It is still confusing.
