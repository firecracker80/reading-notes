>## Events
>
> - Event bubbling - default type of event flow, that flows outward. Starts from a specific node flowing out to the least specific node.
> - Event capturing - this flows inwards from the least specific node to the most specific node.
>
>Flow is important if an element contains an event handler. Modern browsers use event bubbling by default.
>
>Event objects tell you where the cursor was when the event was triggered.
> - screen - tells where the cursor was position on the screen; from the top left down.
> - page - position on the page starting at the top; if the top of the pag is outside the viewport, the coordinates may be different for page and client.
> - client - position within the browser; scrolling doesn't affect the client coordinates.
>
>The most commonly used events are W3C DOM.
