>*Styling and functionality* of the site is going to keep your visitor engaged, and if you are selling a product, maybe even convert. It is not enough to just have all the information on the page.

>I am going to use child rearing for this analogy. From the moment children are born when are responsible for shaping their behavior, attitude, personality, and mindset. As a parent we understand that everything is accomplished over time and in stages. Once we have set our children's structure, we start to mold their sense of fashion, because we don't want our children looking a crazy mess when they step out of the house. This, in my humble opinion, is what CSS does for a site. We are giving it it's own fashion sense through color and font, image size, borders, and etc. At the sametime, we are instilling in them some common sense, manners, and how to behave at home and in public. This is JS. JS is a roadmap on what to do and how, depending on how the variables (situations) are defined. We have established boundaries and identified possible solutions to pick from, based on the variable presented.
