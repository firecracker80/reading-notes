# Markdown 

## Check On Learning

> I learned that markdown is a shorthand for coding that is universal and compatible with various editors. it is very easy to understand and the way it's set up makes it easy to remember the command symbols. I think for me the most difficult is the images, because you have to remember the sequence for brackets, parentheses, and quotation marks.
Some examples of the symbol commands:

1. ** is used when you want to bold a word or phrase.
2. A single asterick is used to italicize.
3. < > are used to create a hyperlink.
4. (>) is used to create a blockquote (it looks like a shaded indented box).

# GitHub

> This was probably the funnest part of the class! We learn how to create a repository, basically a file that publishes as a website. You use markdown syntax to edit the file, giving it format and a little style.
