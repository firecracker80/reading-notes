# About Me 

> Hello! My name is, Yajahira Velazquez, Yari for short. I am an army veteran and I have a web and graphic design business. It's only a year old. Learning to code will give me the opportunity to improve my design, provide better services, and grow my client base.
>
> As I begin my new role as a trained developer, I would like to work with other industry professionals. I believe this will allow me the opportunity to experience working on a team, network, and gain the experience required.
