## What is **Growth Mindset** to me?

> *Growth mindset* is having the belief that we have an unlimited capability of learning new things. All we need is the opportunity, the time, and an unlimited supply of perseverance.

### Reminders For Success!

1. Never try to do everything all at once, break it down into sections.
2. Step away when frustration sets and come back to it when your mind and mood is fresh.
3. This is not a race, it's a marathon! So take your time.
