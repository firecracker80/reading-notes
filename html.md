### Key Principles

> #### Clarity
>
> Is your wireframe answering the users questions, such as:
> - What is it?
> - What can I do here?
> - Did it satisfy my needs?
>
> Don't make the user guess or become frustrated. It should not be abstract.
>
> #### Confidence
>
> Navigating through your site should be easy and user friendly. Use familiar navigation processes and button placement. The easier it is to use, the more confident the user will feel. 
>
> #### Keep it simple
>
> This is self explanatory.
