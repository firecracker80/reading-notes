# What is a *text editor*?

> It's software that you can download or access online, that allows you to write and manage text, in this case code. Recommended features include:

> - code completion (these are suggestions provided as you type, which cuts down on typos and errors)
> - highlighted syntax (color coding text)
> - theme variety
> - available extensions when you need them

> Our computers all have their own built in text editors, but they don't always have the features you'll need for coding. However, you can still use them as long as you write the code in plain text. It's also important to set up a folder, or more accurately described as a directory, where you will store your whole website.

# Text Editor vs. IDE

> A text editor is just that. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is several different softwares rolled into one (manager, compiler, debugger).

> Ultimately, the decision is a personal one. Just keep in mind that a good editor possesses the recommended features.

# What is a *terminal*?

> Basically this the terminal where you will enter commands, get another prompt, then enter more commands. This will continue like this until you complete your operation. In the terminal is a shell that will dictate the terminals behavior and appearance. The most common one is called, bash (Bourne again shell). Now these commands that have been entered, are saved in a history. This allows you the opportunity to search through them and edit them.

> - Basic Navigation
>   - pwd (Print Working Directory) - it tells you which directory you're working in.
>   - ls (List) - tells you what is within that directory
> - Paths
>   - it's a way to get to a file or directory
>   - it's a hierarchical structure that begins with a root directory (/) followed by subdirectories.
>   - 2 types:
>     - **Absolute** - specifies the location as it relates to the root directory, easily idenfiable because they all begin with (/).
>     - **Realtive** - specifies the location based on where you are currenty at in the system; these don't have a (/).  
>   -Additional tools:
>     - ~ (tilde) - this a shortcut to your home directory
>     - . (dot) - a shortcut that references your current directory
>     - .. (dotdot) - shortcut that references your parent directory

# Files

> In Linux, everything is a file (from the computer to created files). Linux doesn't care what type of extension the file is using, all it knows that it is a file. It identifies the type of file by looking at the file. You could even write a file using a different file extension and it would read it as what it actually is, because it looked at the file not the extension.
>
> Linux is also case sensitive. This allows for the optionto use the same file name, since it can be written differently depending on which letters are upper/lowercase.
