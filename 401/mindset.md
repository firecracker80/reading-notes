## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

>I really enjoyed this article. Through out this course I have struggled a great deal with Javascript. It is definitely a point of weakness for me. Prior to reading this article, I had taken it upon myself to seek out code challenges for Javascript. I found one on meetup out of Orlando. I have yet to join them, but I am hoping once I finish moving, that I can make it to their meetup on a weekly basis. That may be too ambitious, given the current course load.

##  Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset
>
>I raved about this video on my podcast not too long ago. Dr. Dweck is spot on! As a society, we are so focused on instant gratification and being right all the time, tht we don't leave room for growth through struggle and failures. Our children are growing up to be demanding, whiney, painsin the rear! I have long been trying to correct those demands and expectations in my own children...not an easy task, because I saw the path they were going down. In school, my daughter struggled with homework and information retention. It didn't matter that I would tell her that it was ok to get it wrong as long as she learned from her mistakes. In life, my kids were getting acustomed to getting what they wanted...my fault. So, I began making them wait and setting limits to there asks. 

## Emotional Intelligence

>So I completed this on my own and then I went over the results with my sister. Apparently, I need to improve my self-awareness. I had moments through out this assessment where, I had to say, "situation dictates." I don't know how I would act definitively in every situation described. I have come to a painful, and at times, comical realization, that I have reached an age, where I don't care. I don't care what people think of me and my opinions. I am not sure when that switch happened, but the assessment made evaluate why this happened. I don't have a straight answer, but I do know that part of the reason has to do with certain painful experiences that made me harden my heart.

# Biases
>
>I wish I had taken a screenshot of my previous assessment, so I can compare if there was any improvement in this area. I know I have biases. I am able to identify when my biases are interferring with my judgement. Sometimes, I have shake myself out of that rut, to see things more clearly. I do have some reservations about the assessment. Some of the statement pairs are contradictory. It made it difficult to give an honest and accurate response.
