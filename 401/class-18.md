# Reading Assignment 18

>## Many to many relationships

>We bign with creating an entity and then linking a database. As in the example given, employees of a store as a representation of many to many. Use the JPA annotations in the respective model classes. These classes should refer to each other, to create a bidirectional association. Using the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable, and @JoinColumn annotations you can map out the many to many association. There are two sides, the owning side and inverse side. In this example the owning side is the employee class, and therefore should have the join table annotation. Store is on the inverse side and therefore requires the join column to link to the employee id to the store id.
