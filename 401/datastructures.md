> - When deciding the type of data structure to use, there are various factors to consider. For instance, what are the fundamental requirements? That is to say, what are the inputs/outputs and what operations will take place in between? This is where you consider which data structure will benefit the project. Another thing to consider is the type of access required and how frequently will this data be accessed, because this will help give you a glimpse of the type, potentially the amount, of data input that can be anticipated. Speed is also a major factor, especially this day in age where we as a society want everything RIGHT NOW. Something we can't overlook, are the constraints of the project. Such as, the amount of memory required, cost, and time to execute;all leads back to how you will compile the data for later access.

> - To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, make sure to implement at least one branch, also known as a base case, which do not contain recursive functions. Another way to avoid this, is to use throw exceptions(i.e try/catch). It may be unconventional, but throw exceptions are designed to catch the error and throw them from the method, effectively stopping the infinite recursive stack.
