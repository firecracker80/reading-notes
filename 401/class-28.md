> 1. What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?
> - RecyclerView allows for the display of large data in a way that is easier to consume because of how the data is layed out. In RecyclerView, we have the option to display the data in a linear output, grid, or staggered. This versitility makes this feature dynamic, along with the fact that the data displayed doesn't disappear when we scroll away from it. The space is simply reused to display the current data being viewed.
