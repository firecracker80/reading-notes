## Different types of loops in Java 
//Retreived from baeldung.com

>**For Loop**
>
>A control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.
>
>**While Loop**
>
>Repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.
>
>**Do-While Loop**
>
>Works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

## Java Arrays
>
>Although an array is a container for a set of data, it is frequently more helpful to think of an array as a set of variables of the same type. The kind of array the variable can reference must be declared before it can be used to reference an array in a program. To access the elements in array you use the index, since arrays are 0-based, the index starts at 0,1,2, and so on. To process an array you can use one of two loops, for and forEach.
> - forEach - traverse the whole array in sequence with having to use the index.
>
>Arrays can also be passed to methods, by invoking that method, which can then return an array. Array classes use different static methods to sort and search, compare, and fill the array.
> - public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object key) - sort, then searches,and returns an index of the search key.
> - public static boolean equals(long[] a, long[] a2) - if the two arrays are equal(same number of elements and corresponding pairs are equal) it will return true.
> - public static void fill(int[] a, int val) - specified value asigned to each element.
> - public static void sort(Object[] a) - sorts into ascending order.

## Things I would like to know more about...
>Since the first link could not be read, I am curious about Java imports. It is something that cam up in Lab 1 during debugging.
