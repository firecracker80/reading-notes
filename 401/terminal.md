# Terminal Practice

>When I first started this course series in May, everything was like, "WOW!", "OMG!", "WHAT DID I GET MYSELF INTO?". Then, when we started to do all the hands on stuff, like playing around in the terminal, it changed to, "COOL!!!", "Ooo, I WANNA TRY THAT!", things just began to get interesting with each class. I still find it amazing how much can be learned in such a short time.

>After 301, I had a 5 week hiatus. During that time, I hadn't done much coding...life took over. However, around week 3, I decided to recreate my company website, because I had the desire to implement all I had learned. This assignment, reminded me of some of the things I had to relearn, because I hadn't been coding in weeks! I had to look up, creating a directory,linking my VSCode to the terminal again, switching between files and directories. It just goes to show how much you forget when you don't use it consistently.

>Going through the reading served as a great refresher in navigating through the terminal commands. For example, when I began to complete the assignment for Java online in Intellij, I had to reread the instructions, because I couldn't tell if it wastelling me to run the mkdir command in the terminal of in Intellij. Of course, I figured it out, felt foolish for even struggling through that. Another example, was when I created the file for the SQL assignment, I could figure out why my screenshots weren't showing up. After reading the part about realtive and absolute paths, something just clicked! i was able to go back and fix my error.

>I am so used to creating file names with spaces, that I had forgotten about the issue with spaces in names. The terminal sees them as two commands, so we need to be careful.

>I did learn something ne, that I hadn't known before. Two things actually, the first being the manual pages. What a great tool to have! Each command with a description and options you can use for various things. The second is the search of the manual pages. I tried it out with man -k directory, and I got a list of commands I coud use and a brief description of each one.

## Things I want to to know more about...
