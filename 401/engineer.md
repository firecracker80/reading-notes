>This article spoke to me. When I first started my business, I said yes a lot. i was trying to create a clientele in the worst of ways. I had lots of recommendations, but few peope whated to pay my worth. I am very good at what I do. Quick, detail oriented, and am often in tuned to what the client's vision is. 
>
>What I found over time, is that people saw me as someone who needed them more than they needed me. Of course, that was never the case, however, that is the perception I was giving. Once I realized that, I began letting go of a certain type of client. My biggest client paid me well to build her website, but then she didn't want to pay my monthly fee to maintain her site, yet still maintain her site. It took me a little less than a year to get her to create her own account and transfer her website. Instantly, stress free! Now I can focus on what I truly want to do. I want to offer my services to mid - high level companies, that can pay me what I am worth. Having gone through these last months with Codefellows has added a level of quality, I could not offer before. More importantly, I have learned that I don't have to do it all myself.

>
> - This is a difficult question to answer, because I have yet to find my niche, though I believe that that is starting to take shape. I am a people pleaser, I REALLY hate to admit that, but I am. Having said that, I have always lived in service of others. It is my family's legacy, we all served in the military. It is something I was raised to believe is more important than serving yourself. So, what do I bring? I bring to the table a laser focus on finding what the client is truly asking for and finding the solution to it,then executing in the shortest time possible, without foresaking quality.

>## How to think like a programmer
>
>This one I'll admit is going to be a tough one. I am a problem solver by nature. I usually find a solution that works and adapt it to the problem at had,so much so that it becomes a routine. However, this level of thinking is different, because as go through this course, I find that I get stuck a lot, and when I am exhausted, I draw a blank. Getting out of that is hard, because while I KNOW I should step away for awhile, I persist because I want to solve the problem. It is even more difficult during this fast paced environment, because there are only so many hours in a day, and you have to make time for everything. Only time will tell.

>## Solving Problems
>
>During this course is where I really got to see the process of whiteboarding. I see the benefits of taking the necessary time to plan. I want to. In this beginning phase it is difficult because I feel the pressure to finish within a timeframe. This is definitely a skill to develop.

>## The 5 Whys
>
>the 5 whys is based on the go and see approach, and is most effective in simple or moderately difficult problems. Be careful, because this technique tends to go down a single track. To use the 5 whys, you need to assemble a team that is familiar with the problem, define the problem, and then start asking why. From those responses, ask why four more times, but you have to know when to stop asking why, otherwise you will end up going down a rabbit hole. Once you'veidentified the root cause, tackle it and keep an eye on the progress.

>## The Super Mario Effect
>
>I can relate to this! I have had to restart in life more times, than I care to admit. I am restarting now! When I started medical school, I had just got out of an abusive relationship, I was a single mother barely making it on my salary. I quit my federal job and took a leap of faith. Now school, is all about pass/fail and the grades. This type of environment did not encourage the idea of,"Great! You got this far, now let's go further." For me, I felt the pressures of my failures, because if I didn't preform to standard I was going to fail out. 
>
>While I didn't fail out, life definielty hit me hard. I am in the process of divorce. I had to quit medical school because I could no longer afford to pay school and living expenses on my own. So I started over. I had already started my company, and my company has undergone 3 major changes. I first started in MLM, then I began coaching, and now I found my place in web development. Every time I learned something new in marketing and the online presence, I felt drawn in further to learn more. I made losts of mistakes, but with each one, I learned more and got a little further. That led me to here. I am successful just using these plug and play platforms, but I want more. So now, my company, while still in web development, is taking on a new feature, a new look, adding to what is still there. None of this is easy for a veteran with TBI, over 40, and a single parent, but it drives me to supercede what could be viewed as limitations.
